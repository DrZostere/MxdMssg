Click button to choose a bike and a trip
Code first selects which bike to take and then outputs a trip to take based on the bike chosen.

Ongoing issue that I can't seem to solve is that the page will not auto refresh to allow a second go at selecting the ouput. Page must first be manually refreshed.
